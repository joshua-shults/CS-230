The Gaming Room is a development studio who wanted to design a browser based game that could be accessed on all platfroms. The game needed to be hosted in a robust server to allow for large volumes of user traffic
and it needed to be able to scale up or down to meet demands.
I think what I did particularly well in this documentation is describing the benefits of following my design concerning dev time and start-up costs.
When developing the code for portions of the project, working from a design document gave clear directions on what the client wanted their product to do and how users would be interacting with their software.
If I could revise one part of my document I would revise the recommendations section, I would improve upon it by describing the systems I believe would be best for Draw It or Lose It in a more "professional"
manner for lack of a better word.
In my interpretations of the client's needs I recommended the use of either Linux for traditional hardware, but preferabbly a Cloud host for the server to go along with the company's desire for a robust server
that can be scaled with the volume of users present. It is important to consider the user's needs as well when designing to ensure that a easy to use product with features commonly requested makes its way into
the final product.
I approached designing software with the clients needs at the forefront of my mind rather than how I personally would develop their product. For the future, I plan on doing much heavier research into costs,
liscencing fees, as well as having good knowledge on any architecture I recommend.
